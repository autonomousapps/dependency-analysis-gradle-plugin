/**
 * A dependency's declaration is the configuration that it's declared on (by user or plugin). A dependency may actually
 * be declared on more than one configuration, and that would not be an error.
 *
 * Declarations must be associated with a well-known [bucket] such as **implementation**, **api**, etc. That is,
 * analysis on ad hoc configurations is unsupported.
 *
 * Declarations are also always associated with a [variant]. For JVM projects (Java, Kotlin, etc.), this is a fancy way
 * of referring to the _source set_ (main, test). For Android projects, it is the combination of source set and
 * _variant_ (e.g., debug, release, buildTypeFlavor).
