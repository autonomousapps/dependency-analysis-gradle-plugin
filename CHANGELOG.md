Dependency Analysis Plugin Changelog

# Version 0.68.1 (not released yet)
* [Fixed] Update supported version of AGP 4.2.0 to Canary 16

# Version 0.68.0
* [Fixed] Improved analysis of annotations for ABI reporting.
* [Fixed] Be null-safe.

# Version 0.67.0
* [Fixed] Annotations on public classes, public methods, and parameters of public methods are part

 ([#296](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/296))

# Version 0.66.0
* [New] Visualize project dependencies and reverse-dependencies (dependents) with 
```
./gradlew :projectGraphReport
```
or see the dependents of a specific project with
```

```
dot -Tsvg path/to/file.gv -o output.svg
```
* [New] Configure artifacts-clearing behavior with a new system property, 
`dependency.analysis.clear.artifacts=<true|false>`. This can be added to the command line invocation
 or added to `gradle.properties`. Default is `true`.
 ([#321](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/321))


# Version 0.65.0

the configuration cache.
* [Fixed] Optimize GraphBuilder algorithm to dramatically improve performance.

# Version 0.64.0
* [New] Run `./gradlew :ripples` to see expected downstream impacts from upstream changes.
* [New] Colorize console output (only used experimentally in `ripples` right now).
* [Fixed] Detect imports in Kotlin source even when @file:<Anything> is used.
* [Fixed] Filter out Java Platform modules when creating transitive-use relations.

* [New] `Reason` now includes more information about dependencies, specifically Android manifest
  components and security providers.
* [Fixed] Safe-cast to `ProjectDependency` to prevent mysterious NPE.
([#295](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/295))
* [Fixed] Dependency graph doesn't show flat jars.
* Improved console output. 
* Improved exception message when build is configured to fail.
* Now building with Gradle 6.7.

Thanks to Vladimir Sitnikov [@vlsi](https://github.com/vlsi) for discussing several issues and
reviewing PRs for this release.

# Version 0.61.0
* [New] New `:proj:projectHealth` task added to each subproject/module in a build. This is a new 
primary end-user target and will respect the user-defined `severity` behavior, similar to 
`:buildHealth`. Furthermore, the `:failOrWarn` task has been removed, and now `:buildHealth` will
simply fail itself. 
([Issue 273](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/273))
* [Fixed] Flat jar file dependencies mis-reported in several interesting ways.
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (4.1.0-rc03 and 4.2.0-alpha12) 

# Version 0.60.0
* [Fixed] Does not union global and local rules as expected.
([Issue 273](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/273))
* [Fixed] In-memory cache now has a configurable eviction policy.
([Issue 274](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/274))
* [Fixed] Sometimes a dependency can appear multiple times in the advice.

# Version 0.59.0
* [New] Kotlin stdlib now a dependency bundle by default, improving ergonomics for Kotlin users.
* [New] Improved on _reason_ experimental feature. Try it out:
```
./gradlew proj:reason --id com.squareup.okio:okio
```
* Do less work during configuration.

# Version 0.58.0
* [New] New experimental feature to provide insight into the reason for the plugin's advice. For 
example:
```
./gradlew proj:reasonDebug --id com.squareup.okio:okio
``` 
* [Fixed] Fails to recognize when dependencies have been declared on multiple configurations.
([Issue 257](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/257))
* [Fixed] Eagerly realizing tasks.
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (4.1.0-rc02 and 4.2.0-alpha09) 
* Updated test matrix to run against Gradle 6.6.1.

# Version 0.57.0
* [Fixed] LocateDependenciesTask remains up to date even after changing dependency configurations
([Issue 255](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/255)).
* [Fixed] Works better with Kotlin Multiplatform Projects 
([Issue 228](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/228)).
(Thank you to Martin Bonnin @martinbonnin for contributing this!)
* [Fixed] AARs with only native libs wrongly declared unused
([Issue 252](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/252)).
* [Fixed] Don't try to analyze `module-info.class` files.
([Issue 239](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/239))

# Version 0.56.0
* [Fixed] Unhook plugin from `assemble` task, to which it was yoked against its will. The upshot is
that running `assemble` will no longer trigger the plugin's tasks to run. Using the 
**Build Project** button in Android Studio will also no longer trigger the plugin's tasks.
* [Fixed] Don't do too much work during configuration for the `LocateDependenciesTask`.
* No longer disable plugin configuration when in the context of Android Studio. This was causing
more problems than it solved (and may not even have solved anything). 
* Improved warning message about using a version of AGP outside of the known-good range.

# Version 0.55.0
* Don't call `await()` on `WorkerExecutor`s, which should improve runtime performance, and was
unnecessary anyway. 

# Version 0.54.0
* [Fixed] Crashes in the presence of file dependencies (flat jars).
* Improved efficiency in bytecode analysis, which should reduce memory pressure and CPU usage.

# Version 0.53.1
* [Fixed] Inadvertently built 0.53.0 with Java 9, which leads to compatibility issues with projects
that use Java 8.

# Version 0.53.0
* [New] Improved support for Spring Boot and Kotlin Multiplatform Projects. This plugin no longer
relies on the `jar` task, which is disabled by these plugins. Instead, it uses compiled class files
as its input.
* [New] The plugin will not suggest `api` dependencies for Spring Boot projects.
* Now built with Gradle 6.5.1.
* Now compiling against AGP 4.0.1 and testing against AGPs 3.5.4, 3.6.4, and 4.0.1.

# Version 0.52.0
* [New] Provide suggested fix on Android unit test compilation failure. Partially resolves 
[Issue 205](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/issues/205).
* [Fixed] Android Studio reports configuration failure due to changes in 0.50.0.
* [Fixed] Don't suggest changing an implementation dependency to testImplementation when it is 
actually used in the main source.
* Now compiling against AGP 4.0.0.

# Version 0.51.0
* [Fixed] Don't crash when unit test variants have been disabled.
(Thank you to Stephane Nicolas @stephanenicolas for contributing this!)

# Version 0.50.0
* [New] Plugin disables itself if invoked from the IDE, to workaround an issue with Android Studio's
`Make project`.
* [New] You can disable most console output with a new system property, 
`dependency.analysis.silent=true`. This can be added to the command line invocation or added to 
`gradle.properties`.

# Version 0.49.0
* [Fixed] Detect star imports as supported annotation types.
* [Fixed] Detect if jar task has been disabled and provide more useful error message if so. 

# Version 0.48.0
* [New] Analyze test source in order to provide advice relating to test dependencies.
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (4.1.0-beta01 and 4.2.0-alpha01) 
* Deprecated 'master' branch in favor of new 'main' branch.

# Version 0.47.0
* [New] The concept of dependency "facades" has been formalized as "logical dependencies", aka
"bundles". `dependencyAnalysis.setFacadeGroups()` is now deprecated and is a no-op. Users should 
instead use `dependencyAnalysis.dependencies {}` to specify their bundles. Finally, with this 
change, the Kotlin stdlib family is no longer considered a bundle by default.
(Thanks to Zac Sweers @ZacSweers for talking with me about how to name this new feature)
* Simplified and reduced the amount of logging.
* Building with Gradle 6.5. Added Gradle 6.5 to the test matrix.

# Version 0.46.0
* [New] New `registerPostProcessingTask()` method on the extension to register a custom task to 
execute with the `ComprehensiveAdvice` produced by the project as an input.
* [New] Can now filter/configure compileOnly advice, analogous to other kinds of advice.
* [New] Improved DSL for configuring plugin behavior. See the
[wiki](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/wiki/Customizing-plugin-behavior)
for more information.
(Thank you to Stephane Nicolas @stephanenicolas for contributing this!)
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (4.0.0!).

# Version 0.45.0
* [New] All advice, both dependency- and plugin-related, is now aggregated at the project level for
easier consumption. The extension methods `adviceOutputFor(variant: String)` has been changed to
`adviceOutput()`. It no longer returns a nullable `RegularFileProperty`. This output is now always
non-null, but may nevertheless _contain_ a null value, so you should use `getOrElse()`.
Finally, the type of the output has changed from `Set<Advice>` to `Set<ComprehensiveAdvice>`.
* [Fixed] `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when parsing empty source directory.
* Several root-level aggregate tasks were removed as no longer useful.

# Version 0.44.0
* [New] Improved support for Android variants in dependency analysis. Plugin now analyzes all 
source sets / variants for each execution of `buildHealth`.
* [Fixed] Build cache issue with `ArtifactsAnalysisTask`. (Thanks to @Paladinium for filing the 
issue and providing a reproducer!)
* [Deprecated] The `setVariants()` method is now deprecated; it no longer does anything, and will be
removed in v1.0.0.
* No longer attempts to parse Java stubs generated by kapt. No tests break, so ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (4.0.0-rc01).
* Staging repo closing and release process is now semi-automated (with thanks to 
Niklas Baudy @vanniktech, https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin)

# Version 0.43.0
* [New] New `setDependencyRenamingMap()` method on the DSL allows customizing some output with 
semantic dependency names. See the javadoc for more information. More output will be mapped in a
future release. (Thank you to Stephane Nicolas @stephanenicolas for contributing this!)
* Building plugin with Gradle 6.4.1, and testing against same.
* Comment on PRs with build scan URL when there is a failure.

# Version 0.42.0
* [New] Support the `application` plugin.
* [New] New `abi` exclusions DSL. See the wiki for details. (Thanks to Zac Sweers @ZacSweers for the
contribution!)
* [New] Detects usages that only appear in a generic context, and javadoc too (as a side effect).
* [New] Does not suggest removing dependencies that supply security providers (such as Conscrypt).
* Now publishing snapshots on every push to master.
* Building plugin with Gradle 6.4, and testing against same.
* Updated to latest AGP, 4.1.0-alpha09.

# Version 0.41.0
* [New] Supports the concept of "facade" dependencies. See the new wiki for details.
* Post-processing support has been improved. See the new wiki for details.
* Most of what was in the over-long readme has been moved to the wiki.
* `OutputPaths` is back to internal. We have a new way to make outputs available.
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (4.0.0-beta05, 4.1.0-alpha08).

# Version 0.40.0
* [New] Console report now stored on disk for easier human consumption.
(Thank you to Stephane Nicolas @stephanenicolas for contributing this!)
* [New] `OutputPaths` is now non-internal at `com.autonomousapps.OutputPaths`. This makes it 
possible to consume plugin outputs without having to reference its tasks.
* [New] `Advice` json for "remove" and "add" advice now indicates used-transitive dependencies (for
the former) and parents or upstream dependencies (for the latter).
* [Fixed] Reports Java service loaders as unused. Due to their runtime nature, they will now be 
filtered from the unused dependencies advice.
* Updated to latest AGPs at time of writing (3.6.3, 4.0.0-beta04, 4.1.0-alpha06).
* Added a CONTRIBUTING guide (Thank you to Stephane Nicolas @stephanenicolas for assisting with 
this)

# Version 0.39.0
* [New] Reports when kapt has been applied but there are no annotation processors present.
* [New] Reports when either the `java-library` or `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm` have been redundantly
applied. Laid the groundwork for reporting other plugin issues.
* [Fixed] Reports unused dependencies that are on a flavor-based configuration as being on a "null"
configuration.
* Re-organized the model code. In particular, moved `Advice` and `Dependency` to a non-internal
package. These should now be considered part of the plugin's public API.
* Added an "intermediates" directory to the output, so it's more clear to end-users which files
they should care about.

# Version 0.38.0
* [Fixed] Plugin now correctly detects usage of annotation processors that support annotations with
`SOURCE` retention policies.

* [New] New extension method `chatty()` lets users set console logging preference.
* [Fixed] Don't use default Locale when capitalizing strings. 

# Version 0.35.0
* [Fixed] Plugin gives redundant advice (suggests moving compileOnly dep to compileOnly). This impacted both
console output and advice.json.
* Plugin no longer eagerly fails if a version of AGP is used outside of the known-good range.
Instead it emits a warning.

# Version 0.34.0
* [Fixed] Check for presence of ContentProvider or Service in contributed Android manifests.
Such Android libraries are now considered used, even if they don't appear in the compiled classes of a project.
(nb: this ensures LeakCanary is not considered unused.)
* [Fixed] Reports appcompat as unused when its resources are (but not by Java/Kotlin source).
* [Fixed] Deprecation warning with AGP 4+ for `android.viewBinding` and `android.dataBinding`.
Fixed issue with `AgpVersion` comparisons.

# Version 0.33.0
* Added extension option for ignoring "-ktx" dependencies. See README for more information.
