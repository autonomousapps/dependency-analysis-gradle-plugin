== Use cases
. Produces an "advice" report which indicates:
* Unused dependencies which should be removed.
* Declared dependencies which are on the wrong configuration (api vs implementation)
* Transitively used dependencies which ought to be declared directly, and on which configuration.
* Dependencies which could be declared on the `compileOnly` configuration, as they're not required
at runtime.
* Annotation processors which could be removed as unused.
* Plugins that are applied but which can be removed.

This is printed to console in a narrative form, and also written to disk as JSON. The JSON output
has three components (see the `Advice` model class):

[start=2]
. Dependency (identifier + resolved version)
. "fromConfiguration", which is the configuration on which the dependency is currently declared.
Typically "api" or "implementation". If this field is not present, that means it is null and the
dependency is transitive. It should be declared directly.
. "toConfiguration", which is the configuration on which the dependency _should_ be declared.
If this field is not present, that means it is null and the dependency should be _removed_.

== Compatibilities
. Android Gradle Plugin: this plugin is built with AGP 3.6.3. It is tested to work with AGP 3.5.3,
3.6.3, 4.0.0-beta04, and 4.1.0-alpha06 (`com.android.library` and `com.android.application` projects
only).
. Kotlin plugin: tested with Kotlin 1.3.x (specifically 1.3.5x-7x).
. Java Library Plugin: tested with the java-library plugin bundled with Gradle 5.6.4, 6.0.1, 6.1.1,
6.2.1, and 6.3.
. Gradle: this plugin is built with Gradle 6.3. It is tested against Gradle 6.1.1, 6.2.1, and 6.3.
*The minimum required version of Gradle is 6.1.*
. It works with Java, Kotlin, and Kapt. Both multi-module JVM and Android projects.

== Limitations
Given a multi-project build with two subprojects, A and B, and A depends on B (A --> B), the plugin will emit a false positive indicating B is unused in A (inaccurately) in the following scenario:

. Where A only uses Android `R` references from B and those references _are not namespaced_ (you do _not_ have `android.namespacedRClass=true` in your `gradle.properties` file).

This limitation may eventually be lifted.

== How to use
The plugin is available from both the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.autonomousapps.dependency-analysis) and [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.autonomousapps).

Add to your root project.

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  id 'com.autonomousapps.dependency-analysis' version "${latest_version}"
}
----

If you prefer to resolve from Maven Central, you can add the following to your `settings.gradle`

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
pluginManagement {
  repositories {
    // releases
    mavenCentral()
    // snapshots
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
  }
}
----

Or, if you prefer not to use the `plugins {}` syntax, you can use the legacy approach:

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    // available by default
    gradlePluginPortal()
    // releases
    mavenCentral()
    // snapshots
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.autonomousapps:dependency-analysis-gradle-plugin:${latest_version}"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.autonomousapps.dependency-analysis"
----

=== Aggregate tasks
There will be a task on the root project with the name `buildHealth`.
Running that task will execute all tasks in all projects, and then produce the advice report,
aggregated across all subprojects. The path to this report will be printed to the console.

=== Customizing behavior
The plugin provides a `dependencyAnalysis {}` extension (`com.autonomousapps.DependencyAnalysisExtension`)
for configuration.

==== Customizing variants to analyze
If your Android project uses flavors or custom build types, you may wish to change the default
variant that is analyzed. By default, this plugin will analyze the `debug` variant for Android, and
the `main` source set for Java. To customize this, add the following to your root `build.gradle[.kts]`

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  setVariants("my", "custom", "variants")
}
----

If the plugin cannot find any variants by these names, it will first fallback to the defaults ("debug" and "main"), and then simply ignore the given subproject.

==== Failure conditions and filtering
By default, the plugin's tasks will not fail a build upon detection of dependency issues; they
simply print results to console and to disk. If you would prefer your build to fail if there are
issues, you can configure the plugin as follows:

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  issues {
    // Default for all issue types is "warn"
    // Can set behavior for all issue types
    onAny {
      fail() // or...
      warn() // or...
      ignore()
    }
    // Or configure behavior per-type
    onUnusedDependencies { ... }
    onUsedTransitiveDependencies { ... }
    onIncorrectConfiguration { ... }
  }
}
----

It is also possible to tell the plugin to filter out specific dependencies.
Both the `fail()` and `warn()` except a String varargs or `Iterable<String>`. For example:

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  issues {
    onUnusedDependencies {
      fail("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7", "androidx.core:core-ktx")
    }
  }
}
----

Please note that the `ignore()` method takes no argument, as it already tells the plugin to ignore
everything.

If your build fails, the plugin will print the reason why to console, along with the path to the
report. Please see [Use cases](#use-cases), above, for help on understanding the report.

===== "Ktx" dependencies
In Android, it is common to add dependencies like `androidx.core:core-ktx` and
`androidx.preference:preference-ktx`. It is also apparently quite common for apps to not use the
Kotlin extensions provided by these dependencies, but only the transitive dependencies included with
these so-called "ktx" dependencies. When this (quite often) happens, the plugin will -- correctly --
report that the ktx dependency is unused, and some of its transitive dependencies are used, and the
dependency graph should be updated accordingly. Android developers resist this advice, and since
this resistance is fortified by the vast and growing ecosystem of these dependencies, along with
documentation that uniformly recommends including them in apps, this plugin now provides a
configuration option to "ignore ktx dependencies". That may be enabled as follows:

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  issues {
    ignoreKtx(true) // default is false
  }
}
----

This will _only_ ignore ktx dependencies if one of their transitives is actually used. If your app
using neither of the direct nor any of its transitives, the plugin will still suggest removing that
ktx dependency.

==== Controlling the projects on which the plugin is applied
On very large projects, the plugin's default behavior of auto-applying itself to all subprojects can have major performance impacts.
To mitigate this, the plugin can be configured so that it must be _manually_ applied to each subproject of interest.

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  autoApply(false) // default is true
}
----

==== Configuring level of console output
On larger builds, the plugin's default behavior of printing the advice directly to the console can have negative
performance ramifications (printing is slow). If you are comfortable reading the advice as json (printed to disk),
you can reduce the "chattiness" like so:

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  chatty(false) // default is true
}
----

=== Per-project tasks
You can also run some tasks on individual projects.

For the advice report,

. Run the task `./gradlew my-project:adviceDebug`, where "Debug" is the variant you're interested in.
This will be "Main" for java-library projects (where the variant is based on source set name).
It will produce advice reports in the `build/reports/dependency-analysis/<variant>/` directory.

At this time, that is the only recommended task for end-users.
If you are interested in the other tasks, please run `./gradlew tasks --group dependency-analysis`
or `./gradlew my-project:tasks --group dependency-analysis`

== Post-processing

For those who want full automation of detecting _and fixing_ issues, you will want to post-process
the advice generated by the plugin.

A full-fledged post-processing implementation is out of scope for the moment, but consider the
following in order to get started.

.some-module/build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
val paths = com.autonomousapps.OutputPaths(project, "debug")
tasks.register("myTask") {
  val fileProperty = objects.fileProperty()
  fileProperty.set(paths.advicePath)
  doLast {
    // use your preferred json deserialization library. See `com.autonomousapps.internal.utils.moshi.kt`
    // for an example of how to do this with Moshi.
    val advice = fileProperty.get().asFile.readText().fromJsonSet<com.autonomousapps.advice.Advice>()
    println(advice.joinToString("\n"))
  }
}
----

This snippet registers a task in a subproject. This task's name is "myTask". One could invoke it
like `./gradlew some-module:myTask` and it would generate output like the following:

----
Advice(dependency=io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.1.0, fromConfiguration=implementation, toConfiguration=null)
Advice(dependency=io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.2.9, fromConfiguration=implementation, toConfiguration=api)
Advice(dependency=io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxkotlin:2.3.0, fromConfiguration=implementation, toConfiguration=null)
----

The `OutputPaths` class currently has `internal` visibility, but this will be changed to public for
v0.40.0, and also moved to a non-internal package. This is considered the canonical way to consume
the produced "advice" at this time.
