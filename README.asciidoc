== Detect unused and misused dependencies
The Dependency Analysis Gradle Plugin (DAGP, née Dependency Analysis Android Gradle Plugin) detects the following:

1. Unused dependencies.
2. Used transitive dependencies (which you may want to declare directly).
3. Dependencies declared on the wrong configuration (`api` vs `implementation` vs `compileOnly`, etc.).

As a side effect, the plugin can also tell you your project's ABI, and produces graphviz files representing various
views of your dependency graph, among other things. These side effects are currently mostly undocumented internal
behaviors, but they may be interesting for some advanced users.

== Build health

In addition to the dependency-related advice (see above), DAGP provides other advice to help maintain your "build health." This includes the detection of:

1. Unnecessary plugins (currently only `kapt`).
2. Subprojects ("modules") that unnecessarily use the Android plugin, and could instead by "normal" JVM libraries.

== Compatibilities

Please see the https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/wiki/Compatibilities-&-Limitations[wiki] for information on the versions of Gradle, the Android Gradle Plugin, etc., that this plugin is compatible with.

== Add to your project and use
For detailed instructions, see
https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/wiki/Adding-to-your-project[the wiki].

The simplest approach is to add the following:

.root build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  id("com.autonomousapps.dependency-analysis") version "<<latest_version>>"
}
----

For a quick start, just run the following:

----
./gradlew buildHealth
----

== More advanced usage

=== Project Health

You can also run the analysis against individual modules with the `projectHealth` task. For example:

----
./gradlew app:projectHealth
----

=== Reason

You may be curious why the plugin is emitting (or not emitting) advice regarding some dependency. You can ask it why:

----
./gradlew lib:reason --id com.squareup.okio:okio:2.2.2 <1>
> Task :lib:reason

----------------------------------------
You asked about the dependency 'com.squareup.okio:okio:2.2.2'.
There is no advice regarding this dependency.
----------------------------------------

Shortest path from :lib to com.squareup.okio:okio:2.2.2:
:lib
\--- com.squareup.okio:okio:2.2.2

Source: main
------------
* Exposes class okio.BufferedSource (implies api).
----
<1> The version string is optional.

=== Basic configuration

For detailed information on how to configure the plugin, see https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/wiki/Customizing-plugin-behavior[the wiki].

To configure the plugin, use the https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/com/autonomousapps/DependencyAnalysisExtension.kt[`dependencyAnalysis`] extension.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyAnalysis {
  // configuration goes here
}
